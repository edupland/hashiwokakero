To use the solver hashi_solve :

You must compile by using :

cmake . -DENABLE_DEBUG=OFF ; make ; make install

Then it will create a program named "hashi_solve".

USAGE :

hashi_solve + "file_name"


Example : hashi_solve game_easy.txt


The program will return a "game.solved" text file containing all the solution found during the process.


Enjoy.
